## What did you do this past week?
This past week, we covered Project 2, had a guest-speaker tell us how awesome of a company Bloomberg is (it sounds pretty awesome), and begin to go more in-depth about the fine semantics and logic of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming. This week has been incredibly busy for me, but I'm certainly enjoying the work.

## What's in your way?
Project 2: Netflix. This project is proving to be considerably more work than our first project was, and my unfamiliarity with C++ isn't helping anything. I am learning a lot about C++, though, and I feel that my partner and I can get this project finished by the deadline, though it'll be close.

## What will you do next week?
Finish up Project 2. I will also be attending the FoCS dinner within the CS department to meet with government recruiters and look at what opportunites are out that. I am currently employed as a Software Developer/Student (Cybersecurity) Technician, and I'm fairly satisfied with where I'm working, but it's always said that you should keep your eyes open for opportunities on the horizon.

## My experience with the class so far.
My views on this class are more positive, now that we've begun looking at some in-depth OOP/C++ concepts, and the projects seem to be worthwhile learning experiences. I've heard that Downing's Software Engineering class is very similar to OOP, and I'm torn as whether or not to take Software Engineering with Professor Downing next semester as I had originally planned. I've really liked OOP so far, and Downing is a great professor, but I'm concerned that the two classes are too similar, but I've only got two semesters left, and I want to try and cram as much material into my remaining courses as possible. I'm torn between Software Engineering with Downing and a Big-Data Programming class -- if anyone reading this has any suggestions/advice, feel free to let me know!

## Tip of the week:
People always think of mimicry as a bad thing ("you should just be yourself"), but I've found that it's such a great way to grow as a person. While it's certainly important to be authentic, especially in your daily interactions with others, there's nothing wrong about incorporating the best of those around you into who you are. I mean, afterall, where we are as society and as a species is owed to the work of the billions of humans that came before us.
