## What did you do this past week?
Get caught up on OOP readings, and work heavily on my project in Programming Languages. In this class, we mostly had a few in-depth looks at iterators and various Objects in C++. No projects in OOP this week, and the "break" has been much appreciated.

## What's in your way?
Programming Languages. The first project was way more complicated than I thought that it would be, and I didn't start on it until after my partner and I finished our Netflix project (and after a day or two break from coding). I definitely regret not starting sooner, as I wasn't able to finish in time. Fortunately, that professor is allowing the class an opportunity to make up the difference in points in later projects.

## What will you do next week?
Continue working on my Programming Languages project, and start the next Programming Languages project immediately. I also plan on doing a heavy amount of reading for my research class, as well as study for the OOP exam.

## My experience with the class so far.
This class is definitely more enjoyable and informative now than the first couple of weeks were, and though this class is a lot of work, it's definitely proving to be a worthwhile class that isn't as "brutal" as I had been led to believe.

## Tip of the week:
Definitely don't focus intently on just one class, even if that class is more enjoyable/difficult than the rest. Definitely keep to a time-schedule and share your time between classes proportionately.

## Joke of the week:
Knock knock. 
Who's there? 
git.
git who ?
Sorry, 'who' is not a git command - did you mean 'show'?
