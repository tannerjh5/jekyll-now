## What did you do this past week?
This past week, I finished up our first project: Collatz. I feel that this first project was mostly about getting the project/environment set-up, and to familiarize ourselves with the tools that we should be using. The C++ code to complete the project was not difficult to conceptualize/write, and most of the time that I spent on this project was getting the tools set-up/configured properly. I feel that the first project was definitely worthwhile, and I'm glad that we had to use the tools that we had to use. As far as class goes, we have mostly been taking about the differences between pointers, references, and literal data-types. We've also touched on word-alignment with respect to arrays and objects.

## What's in your way?
A tree that my apartment complex refuses to cut-down.

## What's (actually) in your way?
I am starting to get behind on my assignments -- I took it easy for a few days not too long ago, because I figured that there couldn't be **that** much work to do in the first two weeks of class. I was wrong. 

## What will you do next week?
Get caught up on all of my assignments in all of my classes. I also hope to find/meet-up with a partner for the second programming assignment and get some substantial work done on it.

## My experience with the class so far.
So far I really like this class. We've mostly been focused on using tools of mainstream software design, good industry programming practices, and other logistical things that will get us hired. We haven't spent as much time learning OOP yet, and even the first 4 chapters that I've read from the book haven't revealed anything to me that I hadn't already learned from my freshman Java courses. I imagine that this is only because we're still early in the semester. I may regret saying this, but I hope that this class gets a lot more into the "nitty-gritty" of OOP than what we've covered so far.

## Tip of the week:
Get a small hobby that's not related to computers/electronics to give yourself a mental break every once-in-awhile. For example, I have been growing a cactus (and recently, a cluster of Venus Fly Traps!), and it's great to focus on something outside of the realm of computer technology. Don't get me wrong -- I love messing with my Arduino and Raspberry Pi in my free-time -- it just doesn't give me the same kind of mental escape as the 15 minutes per day that I spend focusing on my plants.
