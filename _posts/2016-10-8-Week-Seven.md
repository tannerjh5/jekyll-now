## What did you do this past week?
Our first exam in OOP! Also, we covered the various ways in which an int* can be declared, and how we can construct the int* to point at different declarations of int (const int; int). 

## What's in your way?
College burnout. I'm in my senior-year, and my motivation and enthusiasm for school has vanished. Senioritis is real. I've been trying to find different, novel concepts to keep me inspired, but the inspirations rarely lasts more than a day. Time to see if simple perserverance will be enough.

## What will you do next week?
Finish up my Programming Languages project that has consumed so much of my time and energy, and (hopefully) get started on OOP's Project 3.

## My experience with the class so far.
The class has been enjoyable and worthwhile, and it's taught many skills that prove valuable in industry.

## Tip of the week:
[Terraforming Mars](https://www.amazon.com/Stronghold-Games-6005SG-Terraforming-Board/dp/B01GSYA4K2/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1475943324&sr=1-1&keywords=terraforming+mars). Best board-game ever. Though I suppose I have to add something tech-related -- it should come as no surprise that GitHub offers a search bar to search through the website, but did you know that it also offers the ability to filter your search results to only display code that contains your search query? If you are unsure on the semantics of a particular function or class, and there isn't much useful documentation available, then a code search through github may prove invaluable.

## Joke of the week:
Enter these commands on a Linux system that has the aptitude package-manager installed (a UTCS machine works fine):
     
apt-get moo     

aptitude moo     

aptitude -v moo     
     
aptitude -vv moo     

aptitude -vvv moo    

aptitude -vvvv moo    

aptitude -vvvvv moo    

aptitude -vvvvvv moo
