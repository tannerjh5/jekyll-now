## What did you do this past week?
This past week, we went over how to create Objects that survive outside the scope in which they were called (without having to explicitly allocate space for them). We also went over how to pass "lvalues" such that the compiler will interpret the parameter as an rvalue, which allows for us to transfer the "contents" of an Object to another Object of the same class. I attempted to make use of these new concepts in my Darwin project that was due this week, but due to the difficulties that I was having with trying other novel concepts, along with a rapidly approaching deadline, I decided to stick to what I know so that I could get the project finished in time while concurrently meeting specifications.

## What's in your way?
My sight is too focused on graduation, and I fear that my over-eagerness to start my career and work on some dormant side-projects is causing me to shrug off school as an inconvenience. I definitely need to get out of this way of thinking.

## What will you do next week?
Try to get Project 5 finished asap, and study for my classes (if time permits).

## My experience with the class so far?
Mixed. I'm definitely appreciative for the opportunities to learn C++ and try out industry tools/programming styles, but I fear that there's been too much emphasis placed on those things, which has taken away from the opportunity to intimately learn OOP in a way that you'd expect from a class titled "Object-Oriented Programming". C++ is an essential language to know, and it's desirable to take a course centered around it, but I feel that more emphasis could be placed on the actual OOP concepts if we did two or three projects in languages other than C++. Java and Python are both wildly popular Object-Oriented languages, and their relative simplicity would allow for more effort to be spent on practicing proper OOP techniques. C++ is fantastic for systems-programming and in environments where having low-latency is vital, but in today's landscape (with large development teams, sprawling software projects, and absurdly cheap multi-threaded machines with bountiful amounts of memory), there is tremendous value in a programming language that keeps the nitty-gritty behind-the-scenes and gives the developer a clean, clear, and concise language with which to build. (Hence why Java is insanely popular)

## Pick of the week:
For my fellow QA-testers out there, I want to talk about how awesome [TestCafe](https://testcafe.devexpress.com/) is!  TestCafe provides a javascript framework in which you can develop quick, web-based javascript scripts. TestCafe handles javascript's asynchronous nature quite well, and accounts for loading times of the webpage, element availabilty, and more. TestCafe can be readily installed through npm, and handles javascript files written with a minimal "preface/style". With TestCafe, you can easily write QA tests that run readily run on a multitude of browsers. TestCafe also creates and saves a video of your script being run to help with later debugging of the website. TestCafe also integrates very nicely with SauceLabs.

## Joke of the week:
I’ve got a really good UDP joke to tell you, but I don’t know if you’ll get it.
