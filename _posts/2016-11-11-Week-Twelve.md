## What did you do this past week?
This past week, we briefly covered our final project in the course. Additionally, we covered Object constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, and techniques used to overcome limitations and potential problems when it comes to using inherited functions/methods.

## What's in your way?
I didn't do well this semester -- I was sick a few times, and had some disruptive events occur throughout the semester that caused me to miss considerably more class than I would have liked, and I wasn't good about following up with Professor Downing regarding the absences -- these are my faults, but I guess I can chalk them up to life-experiences to learn from. I do want to advise any future students that may be reading this to not miss class -- even if you're sick. Absences hurt your grade far too much for you to miss class, and the lectures are definitely worth attending.

## What will you do next week?
Finish the Life project, and start wrapping-up my research paper. 

## My experience with the class so far?
After reading the articles that were assigned for this week, the teaching-style of this class became clear to me. I had my reservations throughout the semester about how much time was being spent -- and emphasis placed -- on covering proper industry programming techniques, but I now believe that the dual-purpose nature of this curriculum has been for the best. Also, do the readings! I'm assuming that, if you are a potential future student reading this blog-post, then you are interested in Object-Oriented Programming, and if that is the case, then you will want to do the readings (if only for your own benefit).

## Tip of the week:
Here's a [great article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/surprising-things-ultra-productive-people-do-every-day-bradberry) on how to make yourself more productive. Everyone is different, but I've found that a lot of the tips suggested have worked very well for me.

## Joke of the week:
EDIT: It seems my joke about Denial-of-Service attacks actually caused Denial-of-Service attacks on visitors using specific versions of the Safari web-browser. Instead, ![here](https://github.com/tannerjh5/tannerjh5.github.io/blob/master/images/DoS.png) is an DoS-free image of the jok.e
