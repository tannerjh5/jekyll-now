## What did you do this past week? 
This week we went over copy-on-write, the classes shared_ptr and unique_ptr, and a quick "conclusion" to the class.

## My experience with the class
I felt that this class was extremely worthwhile, with the lectures and projects proving to be great learning experiences. Though, I found that the title of the course to be a little misleading, due to the large amount of focus on subject-matter unrelated to OOP. Regardless, I enjoyed everything that we learned in this class. I found the workload for the course to be moderately heavy, but doable. The first exam was fairly easy, but the second exam was considerably more difficult. To any UTCS students that come across this blog, I would highly recommend that you take either Downing's OOP or SWE course, but, if you decide to take both, do not take them in the same semester (for real). I want to stress to future students that the attendance policy is strict, and the penalties are harsh. Even if you have a lot going on, do everything that you can to make it to class and take the quizzes, otherwise you may find yourself teetering on the edge and wondering if you'll get the mandatory C- or better as required to receive course credit. Don't find out the hard way; learn from those before you: go to class, pay attention, and start on your assignments early.
