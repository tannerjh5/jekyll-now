## What did you do this past week?
This past week, my partner and I scrambled to finish our Netflix project, though to be honest, we were mostly trying to make the program's predictions precise enough to meet the project's requirements. Interestingly, our predictions were far more accurate for our acceptance tests (RMSE of ~0.90) than they were for the considerably larger data-set (RMSE of ~0.99). The project required an RMSE of < 1.00, with extra credit being given for (0.95). Though our 0.99 wasn't quite good enough for the extra-credit, we were just happy to have it < 1.00 -- it took us a lot of work just to get it to that point, so extra-credit didn't mean that much to us after everything. Our program ran very fast, and we didn't even have to bother using the recommended Boost libraries that were causing so much trouble for other students.

## What's in your way?
I'm exhausted after working non-stop for the past 6 weeks, and it's getting more difficult to find motivation for stuff -- just have to grind it out.

## What will you do next week?
Continue working, of course!  Now that we have a slight lull in OOP-projects, I'm going to prioritize some of the other classes that I've been mostly neglecting.

## My experience with the class so far.
This week has been great. The first few weeks of class were very easy and largely uneventful, and I was a little concerned that the class had been over-hyped, but the class is starting to living up to its promise.

## Pick of the week:
The Selenium IDE firefox plugin <http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/> is wonderful for web-development/QA-testing! You can set it to record your interactions with your browser/webpages, such as clicking-buttons, filling in text/form-fields, logging-in, etc, and then saves the recording in a Selenium format for direct playback. You can also export the recording to Ruby, C++, Java, and a few other languages that are currently in the works. No more scouring through the html code for a unique identifier, the Selenium plugin does it all for you!  Even if you only need unique identifiers to access web-elements, Selenium displays the unique identifiers in the recording, which makes searching for-identifiers a moot-issue.

## Joke of the week:
Why do Java programmers need glasses? Because they don't C#!
