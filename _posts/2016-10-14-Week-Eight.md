## What did you do this past week?
This past week, we covered some of the subtle nuances between c++ pointers and c++ arrays, as well as some of the basics of how c++ allocators work, and what separates explicit deallocation from garbage-collection. Nothing too complicated or in-depth, but useful information nonetheless.

## What's in your way?
Programming Languages. I'm learning a ton in that class, but it is requiring a lot more time and energy from me than I initially expected, and I am starting to regret taking PL alongside OOP. Both classes are great, but they both have a heavy workload, and it's starting to really wear on me.

## What will you do next week?
Finish OOP's Project 3 and try to get ahead on my various readings and assignments so that I can spend the next weekend binging on Civ 6.

## My experience with the class so far.
My sentiment hasn't changed a lot.  I feel that I'm not learning nearly as much OOP as I thought that I would (I've already learned most of the information that we've covered through my internship and previous programming classes). I feel that this class has mostly taught me the subtle nuances of C++, rather than OOP concepts. The readings have been great at filling this gap, however, and the further into the semester we go, the more in-depth the class seems to get.

## Pick of the week:
[Twitter Fabric](https://get.fabric.io/) is a powerful software tool for developers of mobile apps. Twitter fabric gives you detailed alerts whenever it detects bugs/problems in your (already-deployed) app. It also alerts you when your app crashes for a user, as well as give you analytical information regarding the crash. Twitter fabric is a powerful tool for maintaining your apps and assuring QA. I'm not going to describe everything Fabric can do -- check out the website.
