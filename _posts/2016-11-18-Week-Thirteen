## What did you do this past week? 
We further discussed the finer points of class constructors, destructors, and virtualization of methods. We also had a guest lecture from employees at Spiceworks come tell us how awesome their company is, and give us professional career advice. We then covered abstract classes in both C++ and Java, and the interesting consequences of making classes abstract.

## What's in your way?
Near the end of the semester, so not a whole lot.

## What will you do next week?
Thanksgiving!  I also plan on coding C++ problems in preparation for our last exam in this class.

## My experience with the class so far?
Great. I'm glad that I decided to stick through the class and see how everything would pan-out. When it came to the Darwin project a few weeks back, I had overestimated my ability and underestimated the workload of the project (bad mistake). I was playing with pointers, casting, and class inheritance in an attempt to create highly versatile code, but I couldn't get it to work. As the deadline rapidly approached, I essentially ripped out all of the broken Species/Creature classes and replaced it with a single class that, while less versatile, would surely work. I tried to stick to the OOP concepts that Downing had taught us throughout the semester (specifically, the no-getters no-setters rule), and I was astounded at how modular this made my project. After replacing the broken Species/Creature classes of the project with a single class that did everything, I was amazed at how well everything else fell into place. I didn't have to edit a single-line anywhere else in the project -- right then, it worked perfectly!

## Tip of the week:
LinkedIn and GitHub are both very powerful sites to show-off your skills and impress recruiters. Tend to your repos, make those connections, get those endorsements -- they help a lot more than you might think.

## Joke of the week (Now, DoS-Free!):
This game I bought said ‘Requires Windows Vista or better’, So I installed Linux.
