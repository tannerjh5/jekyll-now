## What did you do this past week?

## What will you do next week?

## My experience with the class so far?
Great. I'm glad that I decided to stick through the class and see how everything would pan-out. When it came to the Darwin project a few weeks back, I had overestimated my ability and underestimated the workload of the project (bad mistake). I was playing with pointers, casting, and class inheritance in an attempt to create highly versatile code, but I couldn't get it to work. As the deadline rapidly approached, I essentially ripped out all of the broken Species/Creature classes and replaced it with a single class that, while less versatile, would surely work. I tried to stick to the OOP concepts that Downing had taught us throughout the semester (specifically, the no-getters no-setters rule), and I was astounded at how modular this made my project. After replacing the broken Species/Creature classes of the project with a single class that did everything, I was amazed at how well everything else fell into place. I didn't have to edit a single-line anywhere else in the project -- right off-the-bat, it worked perfectly!
