### More Information

Hi, my name is Tanner, and I'm a senior Computer Science major at The University of Texas at Austin. I'm currently employed with the Center for Agile Technology at The University of Texas at Austin as a software developer and cyber-security contractor for the U.S. army. My interests lie mostly in cyber-security and systems programming, but, like most of my peers, I have a general interest in technology and the possibilites and opportunities that our digital-culture can create.
